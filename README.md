  The objective of game Axie Flies Up is to reach your axie as high as you can without hitting any obstacles or falling out of the screen. Use arrow keys to move your axie.

  The game was based on pygame 1.9.1 in Python 2.7 environment. It is tested to support pygame 1.9.6 in Python 3.7. Its compatibility with other platforms remains untested. The python file AxieFliesUp.py contains all game logic for Axie Flies Up, while png files are graphic resources. The current axie used in the game is an example axie from the axie encyclopedia. If oppertunity shows up, the game can be connected to the axie universe and retrieve any axie in the axie encyclopedia.
  
  The concept and artwork of axies are properties of Axie Infinity Inc. I do not have the right or the ownership of the example axie used in the development of this game.
